This directory contains the coding sample for the application to the Research Fellow position at RegLab. The main dofile, union_premium.do, uses as input the data file
cpsmorg_final.dta to calculate conditional and unconditional union premia. These are then saved into a separate dataset, unionpremia.dta, which is used to 
plot the wage premia over the years and produce the figure Union_wage_premium.
